# Prisoner's Dilemma Face Off!

## Introduction

The [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a game theory thought experiment that involves two rational agents, each of whom can cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner ("defect") for individual reward. I will run a tournament, simulating this dilemma. 

It's a hopelessly simple game, but I have a twist which should provide some enjoyment!

## Example Bot(s)

Example bots can be found in `py_bots` and `js_bots` folders. Feel free to copy/paste one of these as a starting point.

## The Tournament 

The tournament will take place following these [game rules](https://pastebin.com/MCHNbf0y). Each bot will play every other bot, including themselves. Points are accumulated for all matches, and the winner is the one with the most points. As the rules are known before-and (and due to the nature of the puzzle), it's likely that a fairly obtuse strategy will prevail, but do your best!

## The Twist!

The twist is that I will run follow-up tournaments, with different game rules! I have a collection prepared, which promote differing strategies. The *true* winner will be the bot that can perform well in all of these scenarios. Take special consideration into the following:
 - `win_bonus_points` promotes aggression
 - `cooperation_bonus` promotes cooperation
 - `defect_penalty` discourages selfish play

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit a bot in Python (best), or JS
- No funny business (internet connection, file access, malware)
- You can submit multiple bots, as long as they're implementing unique strategies
- I myself will be submitting a number of "simple" bots (e.g., Nice Bot, Mean Bot), but will remove these if somebody submits something identical.

## Deadline

Friday 26th of January

## How to Submit

Send your bot(s) to me via Discord before the deadline.
